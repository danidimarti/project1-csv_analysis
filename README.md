# Brazilian Sharks & World Cups
> _A study about brazilian shark's sentiment over World Cup outcomes_
----

## 1. Libraries and Data used:
1.1 Libraries: 
    - seaborn
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - DateTime
    - warnings
2.1 Data source:![here]( https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)
    

## 2. Data Cleaning Documentation: 
2.1. Check for missing values
2.2. Drop empty rows
2.3. Consistent naming convention: 
    - Capitalizatin
    - Word separation
    - Extra spaces
2.4. Fix inconsistencies in Fatal column
2.5. Fix Year Column
    - Drop NaN
    - Drop Invalid Year format
2.6. Remove duplicates keeping first 
2.7. Export csv for data extraction and visualization

## 3. Data Exploration & Visualization
3.1. Create subset filtering Country data to Brazil
3.2. Count yearly occurencies of attacks
3.3. Found median and average values to stablish baseline. 
3.4. define a criteria by which analyse data:
    - ANGRYNESS FACTOR: to be relevant angryness factor should be at least 20% above average. 
3.5. Filter data from 1950 onwards for better visualization 

## 4. Analysis

## <span style="color:darkslategrey">Q1.: How angry did _Brazilian_ sharks get after the infamous 7 X 1? </span>


### <span style="color:darkslategrey"> Q1.1: How was this reaction compared to other World Cups? </span>


### <span style="color:lightslategrey; line-height:1.5em"> **Analysis:** </span>

Data shows that _Brazilian_ sharks do not react negatively when Brazil loses in the World Cup at all, with numbers in those periods being in all time lows. 

In fact, the rise of the 'angryness factor' on the years leading to some World Cups (see 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2018) could indicate that _Brazilian_ _sharks_ are are generally against what some believe to be the Bread and Circus politics surrounding the event. Qualitative data (e.g. interview with the sharks), is needed for further analysis on that subject. 



## <span style="color:darkslateblue"> Q2: How angry were the _Brazilian_ sharks that did attack? </span>


### <span style="color:lightslategrey; line-height:1.5em"> **Analysis:** </span>

Data shows that most fatal attacks happened when Brazil won the worldcup which is leading this researcher to believe that perhaps this is actually how sharks celebrate the world cup. Further research is required to understand sharks customs regarding sports.

### <span style="color:lightslategrey; line-height:1.5em"> **Conclusion:** </span> 
There's no direct correlation between World Cup outcomes and the Angryness Factor of the sharks. However, more qualitative analysis is needed in order to better understand sharks views and costumns around the topic. 

### Thank you!
